x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)
"""
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
"""
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)
#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)
#For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
#U cant
"""
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
"""
#instead
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
